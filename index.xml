You might know me by a different name, and in that case, also hi.
I have a degree in physics, and I write code for fun and profit. When I have the time, there&amp;rsquo;s a few projects I maintain (which you should have seen on my home page). Outside of that, I like to listen to music and go outside.</description></item></channel></rss>
