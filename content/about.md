Hi, I'm tas. You might know me by a different name, and in that case, also hi.

I have a degree in physics, and I write code for fun and profit. When I have the time, there's a few projects I maintain (which you should have seen on my [home page](/)). Outside of that, I like to listen to music and go outside.
